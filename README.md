This is the source code for my portfolio website hosted on GitHub Pages.

## How to Edit

- **CSS File**: Modify `styles.css` to change the styling.
- **Images**: Add your images to the `images/` folder and update the image sources in the HTML files.
- **Contact Form**: Gotta fix this and make it look better. `contact.html`.
